  <h1>Test Automation</h1>
  <p>
    Testing code automatically is essential, especially as the complexity of a
    program increases. In my view a software projectâ€™s automated tests should
    not just cover small bits of code (unit tests), but also the entire
    application (end-to-end tests). My favourite framework to achieve this goal
    is Cypress.io. I have used it in the past to write automated E2E tests for a
    web application using JavaScript. Below is a short snippet of my work.
