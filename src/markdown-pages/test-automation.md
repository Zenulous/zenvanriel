Testing code automatically is essential, especially as the complexity of a program increases. I have experience in writing unit tests using modules such as Jest and Mocha.

Unit tests are great, and in addition I like to write end-to-end tests to really test how the end user experiences software. My favourite framework to achieve this goal is Cypress.io, a TypeScript based test framework. I have used it in the past to write automated E2E tests for a web application. Below is a short snippet of my work during this time, handling asyncronous pages.
